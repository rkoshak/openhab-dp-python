# openhab-dp-python
Implementation of the Design Pattern postings in Python as reusable modules and scripts.

These modules and scripts depend upon the [Helper Libraries](https://github.com/openhab-scripters/openhab-helper-libraries) and it provides an implementation of most of the relevant design patterns posted to the openHAB forums. 
There are some additional modules included to duplicate some capabilities that are currently only avaialble as openHAB 1.x bindings.

To install a library, copy the automation folder under the library you want to use to your automation folder. Look at the docstrings for a given library which will define further configuration instructions. 
Configuration of all of these will require only the adding of a variable to configuration.py, the creation or modification of Items and Groups, or both.
The code itself need not be modified to use in your environment.
